# this sweep is for the grid_size, num_obstacles, and obstacle_diameter hyperparameters

method: grid #should this be random instead? more efficient...?
metric:
  name: reward
  goal: maximize
parameters:
  grid_size:
    values: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]  #paper: 15x15?
  num_obstacles:
    values: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]  #paper: 20
  obstacle_diameter:
    values: [1, 2, 3, 4]  #paper: 2

#TODO: lab meeting question - how do you choose these values? feels like just random guessing.
